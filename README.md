# New-Product-Development-NPD-System

PROJECT OVERVIEW 
-> The New Product Development (NPD) System is a comprehensive platform 
designed to streamline and enhance the jewellery design process by effectively 
managing the workflow between the Sketch Department and the CAD 
Department. This system is essential for ensuring smooth project execution, 
tracking individual designer contributions, and maintaining an organized 
process from initial concept to final product development. 
-> The jewellery design industry requires a well-structured approach to handle new 
design projects efficiently. Traditionally, jewellery sketches were manually 
created, transferred to CAD designers for modelling, and then reviewed for final 
production. This manual approach often resulted in miscommunication, 
inefficiencies, and delays. 
-> The NPD System aims to eliminate these issues by automating and digitizing 
the workflow, ensuring better collaboration between designers, real-time 
tracking of design progress, and a structured approval process. The system 
allows designers to create, update, and manage designs effectively, ensuring that 
high-quality products are delivered to clients within the required timeframe. 
The key modules of the NPD system include: 
  1. Sketch Module: Allows jewellery designers to create and manage initial 
sketches, assign tasks, and monitor progress. 
  2. CAD Module: Converts approved sketches into detailed computer-aided design 
(CAD) models for production. 
  3. Performance Tracking: Tracks the efficiency and contributions of individual 
designers.
  4. Project Management: Assigns design tasks, manages workflows, and ensures 
smooth progression of projects. 
  5. Approval Workflow: Ensures that each design is reviewed and finalized before 
proceeding to production. 
The implementation of this system significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, 
and collaboration within the jewellery design process, making it easier for 
companies to manage projects and ensure timely delivery of high-quality designs.
